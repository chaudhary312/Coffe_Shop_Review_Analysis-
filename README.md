# Coffe_Shop_Review_Analysis- 

As competition continues to grow, online ratings and reviews will prove to play an important role in the success of new and existing businesses. One highly competitive market in the Austin metropolitan area is coffee shops. As an existing coffee shop, or a new entrant into the market, understanding how people are talking about your shop, how satisfied people are with your shop (through ratings), and what attributes of your shop are influential in those ratings will help you prioritize aspects of your shop that will determine its success. Furthermore, understanding how your competitors, and the market in general, is viewed by the public will help you gain a competitive advantage. The following analysis project aims to uncover insights that would help coffee shop owners understand their business as well as their competitors, and create a model for predicting coffee shop success and satisfaction (ratings).
